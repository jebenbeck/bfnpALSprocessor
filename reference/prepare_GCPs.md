# Prepare ground control points derived in cloud compare for further analysis

This function takes a list of txt-files generated by the CloudCompare
point picking tool and converts them to a single geopackage layer. The
points represent GCPs sampled in the point clouds within the pre-defined
AOIs.

## Usage

``` r
prepare_GCPs(input_path, output_path, crs = "EPSG:25832", filename, polygons)
```

## Arguments

- input_path:

  character path to the folder where one or several txt files are stored
  in the format exported by the cloud compare point picking tool.

- output_path:

  character path to folder where the newly generated gpkg file will be
  exported to

- crs:

  character path, epsg code of coordinate reference system. Defaults to
  "EPSG:25832"

- filename:

  character, name of the geopackage file

- polygons:

  object of class `spatial polygons` featuring an attribute with the
  names of the polygons; used to group the output by polygon area.
