# Merge ground control points of 2 datasets for further comparison

This function takes two outputs of prepare_gcps() and merges them for
comparison.

## Usage

``` r
merge_GCPs(
  gcp_data_test,
  gcp_data_ref,
  export = F,
  filename = NULL,
  output_path = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- gcp_data_test:

  object of class `spatial points` as generated by
  `bfnpALSprocessor::prepare_gcps())`. This is the dataset the accurracy
  should be checked for

- gcp_data_ref:

  object of class `spatial points` as generated by
  `bfnpALSprocessor::prepare_gcps())`. This is the reference dataset
  (i.e. the ALS 2019-2020 dataset)

- export:

  logical of length 1. Should the result be exported to a geopackage
  file? Defaults to FALSE.

- filename:

  character, optional, name of the resulting geopackage file

- output_path:

  character, optional, path to folder where the newly generated gpkg
  file will be exported to

## Value
