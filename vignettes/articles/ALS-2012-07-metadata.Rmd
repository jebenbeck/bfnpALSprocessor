## Description of the 2012-07 dataset:

- Acquisition dates: 24..7.2012, 26.07.2012, 27.07.2012
- Company: MILAN Geoservice GmbH
- Spatial coverage: full Bavarian Forest National Park (as of 2012)
- File format of the point cloud: *.asc
- File size of point cloud (total): 574 gb
- Tiling:
  - number of tiles: 1102
  - seperation by flightpath (tiles are overlapping)
- Coordinate system: GK4 (EPSG:31468)
- Vertical datum: unknown

The attributes of the original text files could be identified by metadata descriptions and contacting MILAN:

| | | | | | | | |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| **Attribute** | V1 | V2 | V3 | V4 | V5 | V6 | V7 |
| **Description** | X | Y | Z | Pulsewidth | Intensity | Return-number | GPS-time |

## Processing pipeline

### Convert data to laz

To save disk space and to be able to use the lidR package, all individual tiles were converted from the original ASC format to LAZ format. Hereby, all attributes were named accordingly to the las naming conventions. The "pulsewidth" however is not a part of that and was therefore added as an extra, user-defined attribute. 


### Add number of returns

The attribute "number of returns" is missing. However, it is important as it defines the number of the last return for each pulse, a metric that is needed for the calculation of DTMs for example. So, this attribute is calculated and added according to the las naming convention.
